## About

We work with high-throughput (mostly) sequencing data to learn about gene expression in time and space and combine this knowledge to decode how genomes 
utilize information at all levels, from basic mechanisms of gene expression to organismal or disease phenotypes.

### Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics

Current areas of active development

### miRNAs

A lot of work by present and former lab members has been -- and continues to be -- focused on small RNAs, most importantly miRNAs.
Please also have a look at these repositories, currently maintained by Dr. Sebastian Mackowiak:

 - https://github.com/rajewsky-lab/mirdeep2
 - https://github.com/Drmirdeep/stitch_maf
 
### micropeptides

If you are here because of very small ORFs, which are however deeply conserved in a pattern analogous to larger protein coding sequences,
have a look at https://github.com/Drmirdeep/micpdp .

### and much more...

There are plenty of other software packages that might be of interest to you. Too many to pin here on github unfortunately... 
So make sure you have a look at the entire list below before moving on ;)
